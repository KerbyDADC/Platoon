# Platoon

Platoon
Team Name - Team.
Members - Kerby Dela Cruz (just me)

Platoon is a game where a dealer and player are given 10 cards. They then must make
5 piles from those 10 cards to fight eachother. Each draws a card to decide who goes first
then take turns picking a pile from each side to battle. The higher value wins with
face cards having special values and effects. The first to 3 hand wins wins the round.

Kings will always win the hand, unless it's against a Queen, who will always lose the
hand unless there's a king. The Jack will swap the hands meaning that the value of your
opponent's hand will now be yours and vice versa. If Kings or Queens are opposing
eachother, The higher value hand wins, if the values are the same, it will be a draw

To my knowledge this game was in an optional side area as a mini game in ni no kuni,
a game from over 10 years ago. There isn't much coverage on this mini game and I feel
it's a fun card game that people should play more often. Along with my added rules.

The plan is to start off with the basic game mechanics, making sure that the hands
interact with eachother correctly, then the visuals, cards, background, score UI.
Finally, add some interactive feedback (i.e. cards popping up when selected) to
make the game less stiff. I will be doing this all on my own.
